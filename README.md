**Python scripts to estimate groundwater recharge using six variants of the watertable fluctuation method**

This notebook includes Python scripts to estimate groundwater recharge on synthetic hydrographs using six variants of the watertable fluctuation method. It also includes sample hydrographs. 
Mathematical details and examples are presented in the paper Becke et al. (2025) "Alternative Formulations of the Watertable Fluctuation Method of Recharge Estimation: A Quantitative Comparison", ARC Geophysical Research 1(1):8. doi: https://doi.org/10.5149/ARC-GR.1417, 
which is available at (https://janeway.uncpress.org/ARC-GR/article/id/1417/). The full hydrograph dataset can be accessed by contacting the authors.
