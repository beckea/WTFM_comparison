**Python scripts to estimate groundwater recharge using six variants of the watertable fluctuation method**

This notebook includes Python scripts to estimate groundwater recharge on synthetic hydrographs using six variants of the watertable fluctuation method. 
Mathematical details and examples are presented in the paper Becke et al. (2025) "Alternative Formulations of the Watertable Fluctuation Method of Recharge Estimation: A Quantitative Comparison", ARC Geophysical Research 1(1):8. doi: https://doi.org/10.5149/ARC-GR.1417,
